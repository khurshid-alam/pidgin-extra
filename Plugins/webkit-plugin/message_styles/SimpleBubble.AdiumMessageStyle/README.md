This theme is a simple fast empathy theme that uses pure CSS to create the chat
bubble effect. It is very easy to change the colors to match your desktop, just copy an existing file in the Variants folder, rename it and change the CSS hex color values. There are numerous colors available, as well as dark and light verions and an alternating bubble theme.
